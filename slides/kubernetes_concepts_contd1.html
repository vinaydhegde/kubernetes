<h2>Kubernetes Concepts (continued...)</h2>
<p class="fragment">
<h6>Services</h6>
<p>A <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">Service</a> is a logical set of Pods that perform a similar function. It enables load balancing and service discovery. It's an abstraction layer over the Pods; Pods are meant to be ephemeral while services are much more persistent.</p>
</p>

<p class="fragment">
<h6>Deployments</h6>
<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/">Deployments</a> are used to describe (via config file) the desired state of Kubernetes. They dictate how Pods are created, deployed, and replicated.</p>
