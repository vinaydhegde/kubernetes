<h2>Kubernetes Concepts (continued...)</h2>
<p><b>Nodes</b></p>
<p>A Node is a worker machine provisioned to run Kubernetes. Each Node is managed by the Kubernetes master.</p>

<p><b>Pods</b></p>
<p>A Pod is a logical, tightly-coupled group of application containers that run on a Node. Containers in a Pod are deployed together and share resources (like data volumes and network addresses). Multiple Pods can run on a single Node.</p>
