<h2>Kubernetes Concepts (continued...)</h2>

  <li><h6>Pods</h6></li>
  <p>A Pod is a logical, tightly-coupled group of application containers that run on a Node. Containers in a Pod are deployed together and share resources (like data volumes and network addresses). Multiple Pods can run on a single Node.</p>
</ul>
<p class="fragment">But, why do we even need pods? why can't we use containers directly?</p>
<p class="fragment">Containers are designed to run only a single process per container. If you run multiple unrealated processes in a single congainer,</br>
it is your responsibility to keep all those processes running, manage their logs and so on. </p>
